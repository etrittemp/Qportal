---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Setup

#### Run Migration in Supabase
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `server/database-migrations.sql`
4. Copy the entire content
5. Paste and run in Supabase SQL Editor
6. Verify all tables are created:
   - questionnaires
   - questionnaire_sections
   - questions
   - file_uploads
   - Updated: questionnaire_responses (with new columns)

#### Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('questionnaires', 'questionnaire_sections', 'questions', 'file_uploads');

-- Check questionnaire_responses has new columns
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'questionnaire_responses';
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd server
npm install  # Installs multer, mammoth, pdf-parse

# Frontend dependencies (if needed)
cd ..
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Make sure all environment variables are set:

**Backend (.env in server/):**
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

#### Deploy Backend (Serverless Functions)

```bash
cd server

# Update vercel.json if needed
cat > vercel.json << 'EOF'
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "src/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/src/index.js"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
EOF

# Deploy
vercel
# Follow prompts, select existing project or create new

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
# - JWT_SECRET
# - FRONTEND_URL (will be your frontend URL after deployment)
```

#### Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd ..

# Update .env.production
echo "VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app" > .env.production

# Deploy
vercel
# Follow prompts

# After deployment, update backend FRONTEND_URL to match frontend URL
```

### Option 2: Deploy Both Together

```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# The dist folder can be served by your backend
# Update server/src/index.js to serve static files

# Add this before routes in server/src/index.js:
# import path from 'path';
# app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../../dist')));

# Deploy everything
vercel
```

## üîß Environment-Specific Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

**Backend (.env.production in server/):**
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_production_service_key
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_production_secret
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
PORT=3001
```

**Frontend (.env.production):**
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.vercel.app
```

### Update CORS in Production

In `server/src/index.js`, CORS is already configured to use `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`, so just ensure it's set correctly.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: File upload fails
**Solution:** Check file size (<10MB), verify multer is installed, check server logs

### Issue: Questionnaire not rendering
**Solution:** Check browser console, verify API returns data, check network tab

### Issue: Translations not showing
**Solution:** Verify LanguageContext is wrapping App, check browser localStorage

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution:** Verify migrations ran successfully, check RLS policies, verify service key

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Check JWT_SECRET matches between login and verification, verify token in localStorage

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Update FRONTEND_URL in backend .env, redeploy backend

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Backend
- [ ] Enable gzip compression
- [ ] Add request rate limiting
- [ ] Implement caching for public questionnaires
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexes (already done)

### Frontend
- [ ] Enable code splitting
- [ ] Lazy load routes
- [ ] Compress images
- [ ] Enable service worker for offline support

---

## üîí Security Checklist

- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] Service key only used on backend
- [x] JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- [x] Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- [x] CORS configured
- [x] Input validation on backend
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement CSP headers
- [ ] Add request logging

---

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Things to Monitor:
1. **File Upload Failures:** Check `file_uploads` table for `upload_status='failed'`
2. **Response Submission Errors:** Monitor API logs
3. **User Growth:** Track `questionnaire_responses` count
4. **Active Questionnaires:** Monitor `status='active'` count
5. **Storage Usage:** Check Supabase database size

### SQL Queries for Monitoring:

```sql
-- Upload success rate
SELECT
  upload_status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM file_uploads
GROUP BY upload_status;

-- Responses by language
SELECT
  language,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM questionnaire_responses
GROUP BY language;

-- Most popular questionnaires
SELECT
  q.title,
  COUNT(qr.id) as response_count
FROM questionnaires q
LEFT JOIN questionnaire_responses qr ON q.id = qr.questionnaire_id
GROUP BY q.id, q.title
ORDER BY response_count DESC;

-- Daily response rate
SELECT
  DATE(submitted_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as responses
FROM questionnaire_responses
WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(submitted_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
